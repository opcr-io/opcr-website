# Exporting images

Much like exporting images with `docker save`, the `policy` CLI allows you to export an 
image to a tarball:

```bash
policy save <registry>/<organization-name>/<repository-name>:<tag>
```

:::note
Unlike `docker save` which, by default, outputs to `STDOUT`, `policy save` will save the 
policy to a file called `bundle.tar.gz` in the current directory. The path of the tar bundle
can be changed by passing the `f` flag to the `save` command.
:::

## Example

```bash
$ policy save ghcr.io/ogazitt/peoplefinder

Resolved ref [ghcr.io/ogazitt/peoplefinder:1.0.0].
