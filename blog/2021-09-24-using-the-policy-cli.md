We wrote a quick tutorial for getting started with the `policy` CLI. 

It takes about 5 minutes to complete, and you'll learn how to:
* build and tag OPA containers
* push and pull OPA containers from the Open Policy Registry
* sign and verify OPA containers with `cosign`
* Run a read-eval-print loop, issuing queries to your OPA container

The full tutorial is [here](/docs/tutorial).

## Happy hacking!
